# Netlify Configuration for Express Todo App
# Note: Netlify is optimized for static sites and serverless functions.
# For full Express apps with EJS templates, Render or Railway are better suited.
# However, this configuration provides basic setup if you want to try Netlify.

  command = "npm install"

# Netlify doesn't natively support Express apps without serverless functions
# This would require additional setup with Netlify Functions
# Recommended: Use Render, Railway, or Vercel instead for Express apps
